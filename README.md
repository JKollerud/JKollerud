👋 Hi, I’m @JKollerud

Im a self taught developer who started coding in late 2022. 
I began this journey by learning HTML and CSS. From here I picked up JavaScript and then React. 
I've been using codecademy for the basics and some Youtube tutorials (big shoutout to Net Ninja for exemplary teaching).

VScode has been my main IDE and currently working on projects in React.
